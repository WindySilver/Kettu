# Kettu
A course enrollment system that will hopefully be more intuitive to use than Sisu. Made by a single student as a portfolio project.

Currently working on: Designing

Current status: A demo made (code available under kettudemo folder), designing in progress. Development very sporadic due to coursework taking higher priority and most of the time and energy available.
